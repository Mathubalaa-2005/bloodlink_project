# BloodSync - Data Persistence ✅

## Your Issue is FIXED! 🎉

### What Was the Problem?
When you registered as a donor or requestor and then reloaded the website, your data was lost. This happened because the data was only stored in the computer's memory (RAM), which gets erased when you restart the application.

### What's Fixed Now?
Your registration data is now **PERMANENTLY SAVED** to files on your computer. When you restart the application, all your donor and requestor registrations will still be there!
